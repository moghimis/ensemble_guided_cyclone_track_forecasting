 NOTICE STATEMENT:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   This README describes the sub-directory structure and file layout / format
   for ATCF realtime database files.  These files contain forecast guidance,
   along with position and intensity estimates of Tropical and Subtropical 
   Cyclones.  The data are provided "as-is" in a realtime automated fashion; 
   consequently, the users of the data are REQUIRED to perform quality control 
   of the data prior to use since there is a potential for errors within the 
   files.  

   Users are also cautioned that the data in these files are subject to
   frequent revisions and can differ from information issued in official NHC 
   products. 
   
   OFFICAL Tropical Cyclone forecast information is available from the 
   following messages with WMO headers: 
   
   NORTH ATLANTIC BASIN: WTNT2{1-5} KNHC
   
   EASTERN NORTH PACIFIC BASIN: WTPZ2{1-5} KNHC 
  
   CENTRAL NORTH PACIFIC BASIN: WTPA2{1-5} PHFO
